Resources folder is for network instantiated prefabs.
If your prefab will be instantiated over the network place it in the resources folder, not in the prefab folder.
Plug in folder is part of Photon Network package.
If you created a spike solution place everything inside _TEST_STUFF_HERE folder.
If you are using unity 5.1 you will get warning that says RPC is obsolete, which it is used in photon network plug-in. But it won't affect compile game so far.
